                    <p>The intimate connection between the structure of language in which a person expresses thought and the moral structure that governs his or her thoughts and behavior has important implications for the way both language and morality should be taught. the content of materials used to teach langueage wil necessarily vary according to the values of those who prepare them. It convey a clear moral message, be morally ambivalent or even cause spiritual harm.</p>
                    <p class="dark">The content of moral education, too, can very according to the conception of morality being propagated. One can identify, for example, volumes of educational material in which moral concepts are presented as seriees of virtues, obligations, rules, and facts aimed at improving behavior without due attention to the elementsof language and thought that enhance spiritual perception and foster commitment to social transformation.One can also find programs of moral education that simply ask students to discuss thier likes and preferences so that, in clarifying these, they will come to understand themselves as individuals and gain mastery over their own selves.</p>

                    <h3>What We Do</h3>
                    <p>Reducing moral education to either of the two approaches is unwarranted. A program dedicated to the spiritual empowerment of junior youth cannot, of course, shy away from a high moral standard, nor can it ignore that which such a standard demands unambiguously from the individual. At the same time, such a program needs to allow, as we noted earlier, for ample discussion and for the gradual clarifiaction of ideas. It needs, however, to go much further. Particulary, it must pay attention to the role of language in the creation of moral structure, and we will think about this role in the next two sections.</p>
